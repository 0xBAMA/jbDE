/*==============================================================================
need to handle the binding of images to the binding points for each shader
	- this will grow to include both image and texture usage
		*** texture manager will need to change to make use of this stuff, too

		- in the case where I need to get the shader program handle, I can do a
		glGet with GL_CURRENT_PROGRAM, which will give me the last thing that
		got set up with glUseProgram - this is an easy way to keep the interface
		the same, keeps from having to do anything to different to pass in the
		information
			- bindsets can be then program-agnostic, kind of, they might need
			to know that it's the same name shared both sides of the bus, or
			something like that
